## Introduction

The `download-tomograms.ipynb` contains an example of downloading tomograms via
the Open Storage Network S3 interface. First a search query is run in
CaltechDATA based on a subject keyword (species in the example). You can also
search based on any of the other metadata in CaltechDATA by just modifying the
API call.The notebook then processes the response to extract the tilt series ID
and DOI of each hit.

You need the tile series ID to retrieve data from the Open Storage network. The
example in the notebook uses s3fs, but you can use any S3-enabled tool to
download the data.

## Installation

This notebook assumes you have a python installation with jupyter and python
dependencies `requests` and `s3fs` installed.
